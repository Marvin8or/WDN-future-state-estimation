# WDN future state estimation
The goal of this project is to implement a large amount of experiments to find 
a suitable Graph Neural Network architecture that given an input state of the Water Distribution Network
will be able to accuratle predict the next leak-free state.

This model will later be used to identifies anomalies (e.g. leaks) using the junction pressure time series.
